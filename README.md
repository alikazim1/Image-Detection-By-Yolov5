The code imports essential libraries like PyTorch, Matplotlib, NumPy, and OpenCV, which are used for loading and processing images. The YOLOv5s model is then loaded using PyTorch Hub, enabling the detection of various objects within images, likely focusing on traffic elements such as vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signals.
